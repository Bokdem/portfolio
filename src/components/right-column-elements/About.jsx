                I've always been interested in the digital world and how things work technically. Back in 2015, I successfully finished my studies in Interaction Design at Cibap. During that time, I was also introduced to the technical side of web and app development. This curiosity led me onto the path of becoming a self-taught Front End Developer. Soon after, I landed my first job in the field.
                <br /><br />
                After that, my life took a turn and I got the opportunity to join in on a start up in retail, where I took care of all the digital aspects which come with it. After this journey, I joined the marketing team as a technical engineer. More details can be found below.
                <br /><br />
                At my last job, I learned that this was not the direction I would like to be heading. I noticed I wanted to go back to my ‘roots’, back to the Front End Development. This is also where I'm currently at, fully dedicated and full of excitement. Since July I've started to get my Front End skills back on track and started to dive into the world of React. Below you can find some small projects I’ve used to get acquainted with React. <em>(wip)</em>
